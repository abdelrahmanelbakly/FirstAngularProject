## Part 1: Form

This part of the project is designed to help me practice working with forms in Angular.

## Part 2: Routing and Fake Store

In this section, I've implemented routing functionality to navigate between different views. Additionally, I've utilized the Angular HTTP client to communicate with a fake API and create a simple fake store.
